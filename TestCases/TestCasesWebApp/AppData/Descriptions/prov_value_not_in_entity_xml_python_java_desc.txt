In Python every records is a subclass of [ProvRecord](https://github.com/trungdong/prov/blob/master/src/prov/model.py#L228), which has [value property](https://github.com/trungdong/prov/blob/master/src/prov/model.py#L361).

value property is a set, because _attributes is a [defaultdict](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.defaultdict), where values are sets. It is constructed in [ProvRecord constructor](https://github.com/trungdong/prov/blob/1cb710a26c623c5c706b1c6945c645efd9e925c0/src/prov/model.py#L236) on line 246:

\`self._attributes = defaultdict(set)\`

Therefore, every ProvRecord object in Python has a value property, and in memory you can create record that is not entity and has prov:value attribute, which is not compatible with [PROV-DM](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-dm/), because PROV-DM states that prov:value attribute [can only be in entity](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-dm/#term-attribute-value).

When serializing XML format, there is no validation if prov:value attribute is used in record other than entity.
But this is not wrong, since the serializer should not expect that PROV document with prov:value in activity can be generated by Python. Its the model where every ProvRecord has value, where the problem starts.


When deserializing XML format, Java uses [jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) library. Java finds the prov:value XML element and calls method [Activity#setIndexedAttributes()](https://github.com/lucmoreau/ProvToolbox/blob/20a9edf219e84c383d28283bc199d9ac32903687/modules-core/prov-model/src/main/java/org/openprovenance/prov/vanilla/Activity.java#L190)

On line 193 the [TheProvUtilities#distribute()](https://github.com/lucmoreau/ProvToolbox/blob/20a9edf219e84c383d28283bc199d9ac32903687/modules-core/prov-model/src/main/java/org/openprovenance/prov/vanilla/ProvUtilities.java#L94) method just adds the value into the values_discard list, which was passed as argument.

\`u.distribute((QualifiedName)qn,attributes,getLabel(),values_discard,getLocation(),getType(),roles_discard,getOther());\`

And then we just ignore the values_discard list, not set anything. Thats why the prov:value attribute is ignored.

The equals returns true, but it is because in Java you are not able to create document in memory with prov:value attribute in record other than entity. More about this in:
