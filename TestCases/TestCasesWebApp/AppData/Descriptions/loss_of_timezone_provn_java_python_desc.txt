ProvToolbox represents the prov:startTime and prov:endTime attributes as [XMLGregorianCalendar](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/xml/datatype/XMLGregorianCalendar.html). Therefore, we have no problem creating a document with timezones as we want in memory.

When serializing to PROV-N, ProvToolbox uses the [custom ProvSerializer](https://github.com/lucmoreau/ProvToolbox/blob/master/modules-core/prov-n/src/main/java/org/openprovenance/prov/notation/ProvSerialiser.java).
When serializing activity, Java uses a method [NotationConstructor#newActivity()](https://github.com/lucmoreau/ProvToolbox/blob/ca05849c88a84aae736355569a8bdae78c68b072/modules-core/prov-n/src/main/java/org/openprovenance/prov/notation/NotationConstructor.java#L135) and when serializing the prov:startTime and prov:endTime attributes on line 139:

\`\`\`
final String s = keyword("activity") + "(" + idOrMarker(id) + ","
                + timeOrMarker(startTime) + "," + timeOrMarker(endTime);
\`\`\`

method [NotationConstructor#timeOrMarker()](https://github.com/lucmoreau/ProvToolbox/blob/ca05849c88a84aae736355569a8bdae78c68b072/modules-core/prov-n/src/main/java/org/openprovenance/prov/notation/NotationConstructor.java#L544) is used. There is no loss of timezone.

PROV-N deserialization in Prov Python has not yet been implemented. 
As stated in [Prov Python features](https://pypi.org/project/prov/), "In-memory classes for PROV assertions, which can then be output as PROV-N," implying that only PROV-N serialization is supported.
It has been worked on but abandoned, as you can see in this issue on the library's [github](https://github.com/trungdong/prov/issues/122).
