Python serializes the document.

When deserializing in Java the document the parser which is generated by ANTLR, the parser generates 2 expresions:
One is ENTITY with identifier ex:a, which is correct since we only have one prov:entity, but the other one is EXT with 3 identifiers "b" "null" and "c".
The exception is Namespace.stringToQualifiedName(): Null namespace for b.
Because the first identifier of the EXT cannot be converted into QualifiedName.
