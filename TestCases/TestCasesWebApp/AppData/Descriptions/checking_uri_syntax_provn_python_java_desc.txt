When serializing, Python allows URI to have a space.

But when Java is deserializing it throws exception:
Caused by: java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot invoke "String.length()" because "s" is null at org.openprovenance.prov.notation.TreeTraversal.unwrap(TreeTraversal.java:686)

This is because the PROV-N deserialization generated by ANTLR library generates mismatch token, when URI with space is being parsed.
And when mischmatch token is generated, the string is null, therefore calling String.length() throws an exception.
