PROV-JSON represents qualified names as xsd:QName.   \`"='(),-:;[]."\`  these characters are escaped in the prov:QUALIFIED_NAME, but some are not permitted in xsd:QName. In the document [Mapping PROV Qualified Names to xsd:QName](https://github.com/lucmoreau/ProvToolbox/wiki/Mapping-PROV-Qualified-Names-to-xsd:QName), the mapping between xsd:QName and prov:QUALIFIED_NAME is explained. 
All the characters used should be mapped according to Mapping PROV Qualified Names to xsd:QName document.

We first create an entity in Prov Python with an identifier with all the characters that should be mapped to xsd:QName in the local part of the identifier.

When serializing to PROV-JSON, Prov Python uses [json](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html) library, specifically the json.dump() method.
This method takes a custom encoder. The custom encoder for PROV-JSON format in Prov Python is [ProvJSONEncoder](https://github.com/trungdong/prov/blob/1cb710a26c623c5c706b1c6945c645efd9e925c0/src/prov/serializers/provjson.py#L93).
When serializing identifier of entity in [encode_json_container()](https://github.com/trungdong/prov/blob/1cb710a26c623c5c706b1c6945c645efd9e925c0/src/prov/serializers/provjson.py#L126), on line 144:

\`identifier = str(real_or_anon_id(record))\`

Prov Python uses the real_or_anon_id(), which in this case just returns the identifier back and then converts it to a string.
According to the document Mapping PROV Qualified Names to xsd:QName, this is not the right solution.

How ProvToolbox deserializes this document is irrelevant because Prov Python should not have produced document without mapping according to Mapping PROV Qualified Names to xsd:QName.
