Python serializes this document and when deserializing in Java escape characters are added.
According to PROV-N https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-n/ all these characters should be escaped
<PN_CHARS_ESC>	   ::=   	"\" ( "=" | "'" | "(" | ")" | "," | "-" | ":" | ";" | "[" | "]" | "." )
But Java can handle unescaped characters as well, but will escape them in the process of deserialization.
This is because when using jackson library there is a CustomKeyDeserializer which uses CustomQualifiedNameDeserializer which uses method public QualifiedName stringToQualifiedName(String id, ProvFactory pFactory, boolean isEscaped) with the isEscaped flag being false.
This method escapes the local part of the qualified name if isEscaped is false.
