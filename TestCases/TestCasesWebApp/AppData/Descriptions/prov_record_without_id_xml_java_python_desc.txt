When serializing this Java uses jackson library and if the wasGeneratedBy has no identifier it just does not add XML attribute prov:id.

Python deserialization does not work, more about this issue is in the implicit_existence_of_prov_namespace test case, with XML when serializing in java and deserializing in python.
