Java implements date times as XMLGregorianCalendar, which represents microseconds as BigDecimal.
Java does not have problem with serializing high precision times because of CustomDateSerializer which basically does XMLGregorianCalendar.toString().

Python uses dateutil.parser for parsing xsd datetimes. This parser converts microseconds like this int(f.ljust(6, "0")[:6]. This means that microseconds will always be 6 characters long.
This is why we lose some precision in Python.
