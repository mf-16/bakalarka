When a new namespace is created in memory [Namespace#register()](https://github.com/lucmoreau/ProvToolbox/blob/ca05849c88a84aae736355569a8bdae78c68b072/modules-core/prov-model/src/main/java/org/openprovenance/prov/model/Namespace.java#L124) is used. This method does not validate the IRI.
Therefore, ProvToolbox allows documents with IRI with space to be created in memory. 

When serializing PROV-N format, there is no validation of IRI.
However, this is not wrong since the serializer should not expect ProvToolbox to generate a PROV document with an invalid IRI. The problem arises in the model where an invalid IRI can be generated. 

PROV-N deserialization in Prov Python has not yet been implemented. 
As stated in [Prov Python features](https://pypi.org/project/prov/), "In-memory classes for PROV assertions, which can then be output as PROV-N," implying that only PROV-N serialization is supported.
It has been worked on but abandoned, as you can see in this issue on the library's [github](https://github.com/trungdong/prov/issues/122).
