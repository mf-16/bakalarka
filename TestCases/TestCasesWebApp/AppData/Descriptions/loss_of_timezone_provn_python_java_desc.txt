Python serializes the document with correct timezones, because its using method def isoformat(self, sep='T', timespec='auto'): when converting datetimes, which also sets the timezone.

Java however loses the information about the datetime
More specifically here:
public XMLGregorianCalendar newTime(Date date) {
        GregorianCalendar gc = new GregorianCalendar();
        gc.setTime(date);
        return this.newXMLGregorianCalendar(gc);
    }
Here only time is set and when creating new GregorianCalendar object, default system timezone is used.
I introduced this issue here https://github.com/lucmoreau/ProvToolbox/issues/209 and it was solved here:
https://github.com/lucmoreau/ProvToolbox/commit/a1cb22cbddc60cd4563512f66f03caf58f9f068b
by adding a method where timezone is set aswell.
