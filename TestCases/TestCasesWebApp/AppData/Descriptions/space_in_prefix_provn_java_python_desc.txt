ProvToolbox allows creating prefix with space in memory because it does not validate the [Namespace#register()](https://github.com/lucmoreau/ProvToolbox/blob/master/modules-core/prov-model/src/main/java/org/openprovenance/prov/model/Namespace.java#L124).

When serializing to PROV-N, ProvToolbox uses the [custom ProvSerializer](https://github.com/lucmoreau/ProvToolbox/blob/master/modules-core/prov-n/src/main/java/org/openprovenance/prov/notation/ProvSerialiser.java).
During serialization, ProvToolbox does not do any validation either, when constructing namespaces to the PROV-N format In the [NotationConstructor#processNamespace()](https://github.com/lucmoreau/ProvToolbox/blob/master/modules-core/prov-n/src/main/java/org/openprovenance/prov/notation/NotationConstructor.java#L491).

PROV-N deserialization in Prov Python has not yet been implemented. 
As stated in [Prov Python features](https://pypi.org/project/prov/), "In-memory classes for PROV assertions, which can then be output as PROV-N," implying that only PROV-N serialization is supported.
It has been worked on but abandoned, as you can see in this issue on the library's [github](https://github.com/trungdong/prov/issues/122).
