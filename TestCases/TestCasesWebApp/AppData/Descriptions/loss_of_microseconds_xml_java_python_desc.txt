Java implements date times as XMLGregorianCalendar, which represents microseconds as BigDecimal.
Java does not have problem with serializing high precision times because of CustomDateSerializer which basically does XMLGregorianCalendar.toString().

Python deserialization does not work, more about this issue is in the implicit_existence_of_prov_namespace test case, with XML when serializing in java and deserializing in python.
