Python serializes document fine, but during java's serialization the entity disappears.
This happens during parsing where a mismatch token is created. The parser is generated by ANTLR https://www.antlr.org/
Here is the grammar https://github.com/lucmoreau/ProvToolbox/blob/master/modules-core/prov-n/src/main/antlr3/org/openprovenance/prov/notation/PROV_N.g
But since the PROV-N grammar states that all those characters should be escaped, this result is not wrong.
<PN_CHARS_ESC>	   ::=   	"\" ( "=" | "'" | "(" | ")" | "," | "-" | ":" | ";" | "[" | "]" | "." )
But you can see that both libraries produce different results.
