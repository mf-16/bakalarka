All the characters used should be escaped according to [PROV-N](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-n/#prod-PN_CHARS_ESC).

\`<PN_CHARS_ESC>	   ::=   	"\" ( "=" | "'" | "(" | ")" | "," | "-" | ":" | ";" | "[" | "]" | "." )\`

We first create a entity in Python with identifier, which has all the characters that should be escaped in local part of identifier.


When serializing PROVN format, Python uses custom [ProvNSerializer](https://github.com/trungdong/prov/blob/master/src/prov/serializers/provn.py).
When serializing the identifier of entity in [ProvRecord#get_provn()](https://github.com/trungdong/prov/blob/1cb710a26c623c5c706b1c6945c645efd9e925c0/src/prov/model.py#L481) method on line 492:

\`identifier = str(self._identifier)  # TODO: QName export\`

At the end \`prov_n\` string representation is created by joining everything together on line 529:

\`\`\`
prov_n = "%s(%s%s)" % (
    PROV_N_MAP[self.get_type()],
    relation_id,
    ", ".join(items),
)
\`\`\`

Python just converts the identifier to string, which is not right according to PROV-N. You can see that there is also TODO implying that this is not the right solution.

How Java deserializes this document is irrelevant, because Python should not have produced document with unescaped characters in a first place.
