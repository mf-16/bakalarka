PROV-N represents qualified names as prov:QUALIFIED_NAME. All the characters \`"='(),-:;[]."\` should be escaped according to [PROV-N](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-n/#prod-PN_CHARS_ESC).

\`<PN_CHARS_ESC>	   ::=   	"\" ( "=" | "'" | "(" | ")" | "," | "-" | ":" | ";" | "[" | "]" | "." )\`

We first create an entity in Prov Python with an identifier, which has all the characters that should be escaped in the local part of the identifier.

Prov Python uses a custom [ProvNSerializer](https://github.com/trungdong/prov/blob/master/src/prov/serializers/provn.py) when serializing to PROV-N.
When serializing the identifier of entity in [ProvRecord#get_provn()](https://github.com/trungdong/prov/blob/1cb710a26c623c5c706b1c6945c645efd9e925c0/src/prov/model.py#L481) method on line 492:

\`identifier = str(self._identifier)  # TODO: QName export\`

At the end \`prov_n\` string representation is created by joining everything together on line 529:

\`\`\`
prov_n = "%s(%s%s)" % (
    PROV_N_MAP[self.get_type()],
    relation_id,
    ", ".join(items),
)
\`\`\`

Prov Python just converts the identifier to a string, which is incorrect according to PROV-N.

How ProvToolbox deserializes this document is irrelevant because Prov Python should not have produced a document with unescaped characters in the first place.
