Java implements date times as XMLGregorianCalendar, which represents microseconds as BigDecimal.
Java does not have problem with serializing high precision times because of CustomDateSerializer which basically does XMLGregorianCalendar.toString().

PROVN deserialization in Python is not implemented yet. 
As stated in https://pypi.org/project/prov/, "In-memory classes for PROV assertions, which can then be output as PROV-N", implicating that only PROV-N serialization is supported.
It has been worked on but abandoned as you can see in this issue on libraries github https://github.com/trungdong/prov/issues/122.
