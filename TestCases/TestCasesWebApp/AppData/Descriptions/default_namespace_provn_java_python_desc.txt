PROVN deserialization in python is not implemented yet. 
As stated in https://pypi.org/project/prov/, "In-memory classes for PROV assertions, which can then be output as PROV-N", implicating that only PROV-N serialization is supported.
It has been worked on but abandoned as you can see in this issue on libraries github https://github.com/trungdong/prov/issues/122.
