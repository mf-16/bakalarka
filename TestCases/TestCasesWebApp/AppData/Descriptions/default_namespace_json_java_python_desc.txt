Here we get KeyError: 'defaultNamespace' exception, during the deserialization of the file in python.
This is caused by interoperability between libraries, where ProvToolbox creates file which contains 'defaultNamespace' key.
This is not supported by PROV-JSON, which states that the default namespace should be defined like this:
{
    "prefix": {
        "default": "http://example.org/default",
        "ex": "http://example.org/"
        ...
    },
    ...
}

When deserializing it fails in the def decode_json_container(jc, bundle): method.
Which takes jc - json container and bundle - prov document which it creates.
When going through the jc program iterates through every key and assigns type to it from PROV_RECORD_IDS_MAP map.
This map contains all the valid keys defined by PROV-JSON.
When it gets to the defaultNamespace key it fails to KeyError: 'defaultNamespace' since this key is not defined by PROV-JSON.

But, the mistake happens when ProvToolbox serializes the document. ProvToolbox uses jackson library https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson for JSON serialization. 
In JSON_SortedDocument.java https://github.com/lucmoreau/ProvToolbox/blob/96dd235aba6072c6e7671929b57b61088b9f6a38/modules-core/prov-jsonld/src/main/java/org/openprovenance/prov/core/json/JSON_SortedDocument.java the defaultNamespace keyword was being serialized into the file (understanding this would require deeper knowledge in how jackson library works, so I am not going to explain it here).
After reporting this issue to the author of ProvToolbox, in commit https://github.com/lucmoreau/ProvToolbox/commit/20a9edf219e84c383d28283bc199d9ac32903687, the issue was resolved by adding the getDefaultNamespace() method and adding @JsonIgnore annotation. This annotation is used in jackson ignore this element in the process of serialization and deserialization.
