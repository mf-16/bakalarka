All the characters used should be escaped according to [PROV-N](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-n/#prod-PN_CHARS_ESC).

\`<PN_CHARS_ESC>	   ::=   	"\" ( "=" | "'" | "(" | ")" | "," | "-" | ":" | ";" | "[" | "]" | "." )\`

We first create a entity in Python with identifier, which has all the characters that should be escaped in local part of identifier.

When serializing XML format, Python uses the custom XML deserializer [ProvXMLSerializer](https://github.com/trungdong/prov/blob/master/src/prov/serializers/provxml.py#L34).
Prov Python turns [ProvDocument](https://github.com/trungdong/prov/blob/1cb710a26c623c5c706b1c6945c645efd9e925c0/src/prov/model.py#L2262) representation of PROV document into [etree](https://lxml.de/tutorial.html) from [lxml](https://lxml.de/) library.

When identifier of entity is being serialized [ProvXMLSerializer#serialize_bundle()](https://github.com/trungdong/prov/blob/1cb710a26c623c5c706b1c6945c645efd9e925c0/src/prov/serializers/provxml.py#L70) is used. Identifier is just turned into string on line 117:
\`\`\`
identifier = str(record._identifier) if record._identifier else None

if identifier:
    attrs = {_ns_prov("id"): identifier}
else:
    attrs = None
\`\`\`

Then on line 129 element is created:

\`elem = etree.SubElement(xml_bundle_root, _ns_prov(rec_label), attrs)\`

This is not right solution according to PROV-N.

How Java deserializes this document is irrelevant, because Python should not have produced document with unescaped characters in a first place.
