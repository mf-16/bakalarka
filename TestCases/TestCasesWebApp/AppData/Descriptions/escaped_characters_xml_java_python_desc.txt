PROV-XML represents qualified names as xsd:QName.   \`"='(),-:;[]."\`  these characters are escaped in the prov:QUALIFIED_NAME, but some are not permitted in xsd:QName. In the document [Mapping PROV Qualified Names to xsd:QName](https://github.com/lucmoreau/ProvToolbox/wiki/Mapping-PROV-Qualified-Names-to-xsd:QName), the mapping between xsd:QName and prov:QUALIFIED_NAME is explained. 
All the characters used should be mapped according to Mapping PROV Qualified Names to xsd:QName document.

We first create an entity in ProvToolbox with an identifier with all the characters that should be mapped to xsd:QName in the local part of the identifier.

ProvToolbox uses [jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) library when serializing to PROV-XML.
When serializing the identifier, ProvToolbox uses [CustomQualifiedNameSerializer#serialize()](https://github.com/lucmoreau/ProvToolbox/blob/96dd235aba6072c6e7671929b57b61088b9f6a38/modules-core/prov-jsonld-xml/src/main/java/org/openprovenance/prov/core/xml/serialization/serial/CustomQualifiedNameSerializer.java#L23) method. This method just combines the prefix and local part on line 27:

\`String s= prefix + ":" + q.getLocalPart();\`

According to the document Mapping PROV Qualified Names to xsd:QName, this is not the right solution.

How Prov Python deserializes this document is irrelevant because ProvToolbox should not have produced a document without mapping according to Mapping PROV Qualified Names to xsd:QName.
